# Nix-Darwin Config 

## Information

This is my Nix Darwin config for my Macbook Pro 14". I use home manager for managing applications whenever possible. Furthermore, I organize my file 
system where /users/dylan/home is where I store all my relevant files I interact with. 

## Process

You should ALWAYS use the mcp-nix mcp server for looking up commands whenever possible to ensure you do not halucinate, unless no 
information from it is needed. If you do not get the information you need, alert the user and ask for clarification.
